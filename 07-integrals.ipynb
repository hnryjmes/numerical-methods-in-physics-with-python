    "- **Newton-Cotes methods**: these make the assumption that the integral can be approximated by summing up the areas of elementary shapes (e.g., rectangles); such methods typicall involve *equally spaced abscissas*: these are useful (if not necessary) when $f(x)$ has already been evaluated at specific points on a grid.\n",
    "- **Gaussian quadrature**: these make use of *unequally spaced abscissas*: these methods choose the $x_i$ in such a way as to provide better accuracy. As a result, they typically require fewer abscissas and therefore fewer function evaluations, making them an attractive option when an $f(x)$ evaluation is costly."
